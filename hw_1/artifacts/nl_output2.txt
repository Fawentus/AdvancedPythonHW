     1  Sun of the sleepless! Melancholy star!
     2  Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
     3  That show’st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
     4  How like art thou to joy remember’d well!
     5  
     6  So gleams the past, the light of other days,
     7  Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays;
     8  A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
     9  Distinct, but distant — clear, but oh, how cold!
    10  
    11  George Gordon Byron
